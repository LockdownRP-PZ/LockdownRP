__Take special note of the **Skill Limiter** mod. Here's how it works:__

- Crafting and survival skills are capped depending on your starting points:
0 = 5; 1 = 7; 2 = 9; 3 = 10;
- Weapons skills are capped similarly, but to a lesser extent:
0 = 7; 1 = 9; 2 = 10;
- Agility skills (sprint, sneak, nimble, lightfooted) are capped to an even lesser extent:
0 = 9; 1 = 10
