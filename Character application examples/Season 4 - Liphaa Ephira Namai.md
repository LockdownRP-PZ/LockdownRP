>

### 6. What are some negative personality traits of your character? 
*We expect ~3 answers here.*

> Overbearing - Liphaa can push quite a bit too hard on people sometimes, crossing lines and not knowing when to stop.

Sometimes she can't recognize when no means no and while she has good intentions, sometimes it ends up doing more harm than good.

### 7. Describe your character's general personality. 
*What are their likes and dislikes, fears, hobbies, disabilities, mental illnesses, etc...*

> Liphaa is a ray of sunshine. She loves anyone and everyone, always seeing the best in them and assuming that they could do no wrong. She is extremely naive and influenceable. 
> 
> She likes reading, writing and socializing. She enjoys getting to know people and trying new things. She likes to tinker around with things, try to make little gifts for people, and she certainly loves to decorate. 
> 
> She dislikes mean people, the dark, bears, and spicy food. 
> 
> Her hobbies vary, she tries something new all the time and then tends to abandon it rather quickly. She likes to talk to people, find out what kind of things they do, do it, and then lose interest after a week or two. 
> 
> She has adhd. Horrible. Horrible adhd. She hyper fixates on hobbies, tasks, people, and nine times out of ten can be found staring off into space and on another plane of existence. 

### 8. Describe the general appearance of your character.
*Hairstyle & colour, eyes, skin tone, weight, height, notable features, ethnicity, etc...*

> Bright pastel pink hair. Her hair is a light enough shade of blonde naturally that whenever she can't obtain dye, it doesn't look too terribly different from the pink. She has pastel blue eyes and fair skin, a few freckles speckled over her nose and shoulders. Some around her wrists but they're very feint. 
> 
> She weighs about 104lbs, and is around 5'3. Her only other notable features are that her hands are quite small, even compared to her height. 

### 9. What is your character's backstory?

> Liphaa had spent most of her life in South Carolina up until the virus started. At the time, she had only been seven, and was just beginning to finally enjoy school after two years of completely and utterly despising everything to do with it. Needless to say, her grades were no longer her priority. 
> 
> Not understandingly anything that was going on, she followed her grandmother everywhere she went, fleeing and trying to find somewhere, anywhere safe. They moved across the state, then moved through Georgia, Louisianna, and then began upwards towards Tennessee, and finally North Carolina. They'd just barely been there a few days when her grandmother, her only known family member passed away in an accident. Not even related to the traumatic events going on in the world. She simply.. fell.. 
> 
> Now twelve years old, Liphaa was on her own. She'd met hundred of people in their travels across the states, but now she was in Morganton North Carolina with no clue where to go or what to do next. Her grandmother had been trying to take her somewhere safe- so that was still the goal. She hitched herself a ride with a few people on their way to Raleigh, they declared that she'd be extremely useful later, even if just as a distraction. They were seemingly very proud at their resourcefulness and on their way, one of them got terribly sick with something she still couldn't quite wrap her head around. Her grandmother had explained it to her many times but- that didn't make any sense at all. It was just a scary story she was told. 
> 
> So, she left them eventually, and found some other folk who mentioned somewhere in Charolette called 'Zion', and with hearing the passing word, 'safe', she became determined to get there. What she didn't realize was that they'd said, 'used to be safe'. She spent what felt like months helping people in exchange for them guiding her to the next city over and did this repetitively until she finally made it to Zion. 
> 
> She learned all about the Barkskins and how they were so against the way of life- when she'd unknowingly traveled and learned from several of them. 
> 
> Now, at thirteen, she was working for the citizens of Zion, in exchange for food, and a couch to stay on for a period of time. During this time, she became really good at bandaging people and finding herbs to make simple medicines. She was quite fond of most people and spent most of her time just lingering in the city, considering it to be safe. 
> 
> Turns out. It was not.

> 
> Dear Roselynn, 
> 
> Forgive me for using your name, I know you always preferred that I call you 'Grandmother', but this feels formal. And hey, God doesn't know that you're my grandmother. So how would this reach you? 
> 
> You always said that in the end, everything you did would be 'worth it', and I didn't understand, because I never had a concept of worth...
> 
> But... I miss you. And I never got to properly thank you for taking care of me or getting me to safety. I took it all so lightly when I was little... but you truly saved my life. I am so grateful for it. 
> 
> I finally got somewhere... close to safe. I can sleep without fear. And I have friends here. I live in comfort. Just, have to be cautious. But I think it's like that everywhere now. Nowhere is really all that safe... But you did your best, and it was worth it, and I did my best, and it was worth it. That was all that mattered right? 
> 
> I'll live for as long as I can. For you. For Mom and Dad. For Levi. But when I die, I'll be reunited with you all, right? So... it's a win win in the end. I won, I survived for as long as I could, and I'll be with you. No matter what, it will have been worth it. Thank you, I love you, and I miss you. 

> It's worth it, 
>         Liphaa
