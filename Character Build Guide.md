# Lockdown RP Character Profile Guide

- Start with basic information which will be needed in an RP scenario. That is: First and (preferably) last name, age, occupation, skills and interests
- Talk about life prior to the apocalypse and during the apocalypse (prior to arriving to the spawn point)
- Add any information which may affect your characters behaviour, for example: disease, disability, specific RP traits
- Have clear Short and Long term goals. This helps with establishing a purpose for your character.
- Most importantly, be imaginative! We love reading your characters' backstories. The more detail the better!

Note: We understand that not everyone is willing to write a whole detailed story for a character that will eventually pass away. What we ultimately look for is for you to show that you have interest in joining and being part of the community and are willing to invest some time and imagination to have an in-depth RP experience, for both yourself and the other members.
